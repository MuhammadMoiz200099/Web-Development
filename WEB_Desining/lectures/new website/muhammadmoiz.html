              <h2 span style="color:red"><u>DESCRIPTION</span></u></h2><br>
        <p>The Ottoman Empire was founded by Osman I. As sultan Mehmed II 
conquered Constantinople (today named Istanbul) in 1453, the state grew into
 a mighty empire. The Empire reached its apex under Suleiman the Magnificent 
in the 16th century when it stretched from the Persian Gulf in the east to 
Hungary in the northwest; and from Egypt in the south to the Caucasus in the 
north. The empire came to an end in the aftermath of its defeat by the Allies 
in World War I. The empire was dismantled by the Allies after the war ended 
in 1918.</p><br>
       <h1 span style="color:red"><b><i><u><q>Rise of the Ottoman Empire (1299–1453)</span></b></i></u></q></h1><br>
   <p>With the demise of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum (c. 1300), Anatolia was 
divided into a patchwork of independent states, the so-called Anatolian 
Beyliks. By 1300, a weakened Byzantine Empire had lost most of its Anatolian 
provinces to these Turkish principalities. One of the beyliks was led by 
	Osman I (d. 1323/4), from which the name Ottoman is derived, son of Ertuğrul,
 around Eskişehir in western Anatolia. In the foundation myth expressed in 
the story known as "Osman's Dream", the young Osman was inspired to conquest 
by a prescient vision of empire (according to his dream, the empire is a big 
tree whose roots spread through three continents and whose branches cover the
 sky).[1] According to his dream the tree, which was Osman's Empire, issued 
four rivers from its roots, the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Nile and the 
Danube.[1] Additionally, the tree shaded four mountain ranges, the Caucasus, 
the Taurus, the Atlas and the Balkan ranges.[1] During his reign as Sultan, 
Osman I extended the frontiers of Turkish settlement toward the edge of the 
Byzantine Empire.<br>
     <blockquote cite>During this period, a formal Ottoman government was created whose 
institutions would change drastically over the life of the empire.</blockquote><br>
In the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to extend 
over the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. Osman's son, Orhan, captured
 the city of Bursa in 1326 and made it the new capital of the Ottoman state. 
The fall of Bursa meant the loss of Byzantine control over Northwestern 
Anatolia. The important city of Thessaloniki was captured from the Venetians 
in 1387. The Ottoman victory at Kosovo in 1389 effectively marked the end of
 Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into 
Europe. The Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, widely regarded as the last 
large-scale crusade of the Middle Ages, failed to stop the advance of the 
victorious Ottoman Turks. With the extension of Turkish dominion into the 
Balkans, the strategic conquest of Constantinople became a crucial objective.
 The Empire controlled nearly all former Byzantine lands surrounding the city,
 but the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when Timur invaded Anatolia in 
the Battle of Ankara in 1402. He took Sultan Bayezid I as a prisoner. 
The capture of Bayezid I threw the Turks into disorder. The state fell into a
 civil war that lasted from 1402 to 1413, as Bayezid's sons fought over 
succession. It ended when Mehmed I emerged as the sultan and restored Ottoman
 power, bringing an end to the Interregnum.</p><br>

      <h1 span style="color:red"><b><i><u><q>Classical Age (1453–1550)</span></b></i></u></q></h1>     
     <p>The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 by Mehmed II cemented 
the status of the Empire as the preeminent power in southeastern Europe and 
the eastern Mediterranean. After taking Constantinople, Mehmed met with the 
Orthodox patriarch, Gennadios and worked out an arrangement in which the
 Orthodox Church, in exchange for being able to maintain its autonomy and 
land, accepted Ottoman authority. Because of bad relations between the 
latter Byzantine Empire and the states of western Europe as epitomized by 
Loukas Notaras's famous remark "Better the Sultan's turban than the Cardinal's
 Hat", the majority of the Orthodox population accepted Ottoman rule as 
preferable to Venetian rule.</p>

           <p>Upon making Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) the new capital 
of the Ottoman Empire in 1453, Mehmed II assumed the title of Kayser-i Rûm 
(literally Caesar Romanus, i.e. Roman Emperor.) In order to consolidate this 
claim, he would launch a campaign to conquer Rome, the western capital of 
the former Roman Empire. To this aim he spent many years securing positions 
on the Adriatic Sea, such as in Albania Veneta, and then continued with the
 Ottoman invasion of Otranto and Apulia on 28 July 1480. The Turks stayed 
in Otranto and its surrounding areas for nearly a year, but after Mehmed 
II's death on 3 May 1481, plans for penetrating deeper into the Italian 
peninsula with fresh new reinforcements were given up on and cancelled and 
the remaining Ottoman troops sailed back to the east of the Adriatic Sea.</p>     

    <h1 span style="color:red"><b><i><u><q>Decline and modernization (1828–1908)</span></b></i></u></q></h1>
<p>During the Tanzimat period (from Arabic: تنظيم tanẓīm, meaning "organisation") (1839–76), 
the government's series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern conscripted army, 
banking system reforms, the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the replacement of religious 
law with secular law[49] and guilds with modern factories. In 1856, the Hatt-ı Hümayun promised 
equality for all Ottoman citizens regardless of their ethnicity and religious confession; which 
thus widened the scope of the 1839 Hatt-ı Şerif of Gülhane.</p><br>

<img src ="30.png" width="300" heigh="300"> <img src ="31.png" width="300" heigh="300"><br>
<p>Overall, the Tanzimat reforms had far-reaching effects. Those educated in the
 schools established during the Tanzimat period included Mustafa Kemal 
Atatürk and other progressive leaders and thinkers of the Republic of 
Turkey and of many other former Ottoman states in the Balkans, the Middle
 East and North Africa. These reforms included[50] guarantees to ensure the 
Ottoman subjects perfect security for their lives, honour and property; the 
introduction of the first Ottoman paper banknotes (1840) and opening of the 
first post offices (1840); the reorganisation of the finance system according
 to the French model (1840); the reorganisation of the Civil and Criminal 
Code according to the French model (1840); the establishment of the Meclis-i 
Maarif-i Umumiye (1841) which was the prototype of the First Ottoman 
Parliament (1876); the reorganisation of the army and a regular method of 
recruiting, levying the army and fixing the duration of military service 
(1843–44); the adoption of an Ottoman national anthem and Ottoman national 
flag (1844); the first nationwide Ottoman census in 1844 (only male citizens
 were counted); the first national identity cards (officially named the 
Mecidiye identity papers, or informally kafa kağıdı (head paper) documents,
 1844); the institution of a Council of Public Instruction (1845) and the
 Ministry of Education (Mekatib-i Umumiye Nezareti, 1847, which later became
 the Maarif Nezareti, 1857); the abolition of slavery and slave trade 
(1847); the establishment of the first modern universities (darülfünun, 1848),
 academies (1848) and teacher schools (darülmuallimin, 1848); establishment 
of the Ministry of Healthcare (Tıbbiye Nezareti, 1850); the Commerce and
 Trade Code (1850); establishment of the Academy of Sciences 
(Encümen-i Daniş, 1851); establishment of the Şirket-i Hayriye which 
operated the first steam-powered commuter ferries (1851); the first European
 style courts (Meclis-i Ahkam-ı Adliye, 1853) and supreme judiciary council 
(Meclis-i Ali-yi Tanzimat, 1853); establishment of the modern Municipality 
of Istanbul (Şehremaneti, 1854) and the City Planning Council 
(İntizam-ı Şehir Komisyonu, 1855); the abolition of the capitation (Jizya) 
tax on non-Muslims, with a regular method of establishing and collecting
 taxes (1856); non-Muslims were allowed to become soldiers (1856); various
 provisions for the better administration of the public service and 
advancement of commerce; the establishment of the first telegraph networks 
(1847–1855) and railways (1856); the replacement of guilds with factories; 
the establishment of the Ottoman Central Bank (originally established as the 
Bank-ı Osmanî in 1856, and later reorganised as the Bank-ı Osmanî-i Şahane 
in 1863)[51] and the Ottoman Stock Exchange (Dersaadet Tahvilat Borsası, 
established in 1866);[52] the Land Code (Arazi Kanunnamesi, 1857); permission
 for private sector publishers and printing firms with the Serbesti-i Kürşad
 Nizamnamesi (1857); establishment of the School of Economical and Political 
Sciences (Mekteb-i Mülkiye, 1859); the Press and Journalism Regulation Code 
(Matbuat Nizamnamesi, 1864); among others.</p>
