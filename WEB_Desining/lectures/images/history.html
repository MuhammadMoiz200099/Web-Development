<p>For several centuries in the first millennium B.C. and in the first five 
centuries of the first millennium A.D., western portions of Sindh, the regions on 
the western flank of the Indus river, were intermittently under Persian, Greek, 
and Kushan rule,[citation needed] first during the Achaemenid dynasty (500–300 BC) 
during which it made up part of the easternmost satrapies, then, by Alexander the 
Great, followed by the Indo-Greeks, and still later under the Indo-Sassanids, as 
well as Kushans, before the Islamic invasions between the 7th–10th century AD. 
Alexander the Great marched through Punjab and Sindh, down the Indus river, after 
his conquest of the Persian Empire. Sindh was one of the earliest regions to be 
influenced by Islam after 632 AD. Before this period, it was heavily Hindu, and 
Buddhist. After 632 AD, it was part of the Islamic empires of the Abbasids and 
Umayyids. Islam. Habbari, Soomra, Samma, Arghun dynasties ruled Sindh.</p><br><br>

<h2 span style="color:black">Pre-historic period</span></h2>
The original inhabitants of ancient Sindh were believed to be aboriginal tribes 
speaking languages of the Indus Valley Civilisation around 3300 BC. Moen-jo-Daro 
was one of the largest settlements of the Indus Valley Civilisation.
The Indus Valley Civilisation went into decline around the year 1700 BC for reasons
 that are not entirely known, though its downfall was probably precipitated by an 
earthquake or natural event that dried up the Ghaggar River. The Indo-Aryans are 
believed to have founded the Vedic civilisation that existed between the Sarasvati 
River and Ganges river around 1500 BC. This civilisation helped shape subsequent 
cultures in South Asia.</p><br><br>

<h2 span style="color:black">Ethnicity/religion</span></h2>
<p>The region received its name, Sindh, from the River Sindhu (Indus). The people 
living in the region are referred to as Sindhi. The terms Hindi and Hindu are 
derived from the word Sindh and Sindhu, as the ancient Persians pronounced "s" 
as "h" (e.g., sarasvati as harahvati). In the same way, Persians called the people 
of this region as Hindhi people, their language as Hindhi language and the region 
as Hindh, the name which is used for this region since ancient times, and later 
for the whole northern part of the Indian sub-continent today. India is also known 
as Hindustan. The two main and highest ranked tribes of Sindh are the 
Soomro — descendants of the Soomro Dynasty, who ruled Sindh during 970–1351 A.D. 
and the Samma — descendants of the Samma Dynasty, who ruled Sindh during 1351–1521 
A.D. These tribes belong to the same blood line. Among other Sindhi Rajputs are 
the Bhachos, Bhuttos, BhattisBhanbhro Mahendros, Buriros, Lakha, Sahetas, Lohanas, 
Mohano, Dahars, Indhar, Chachar, Dhareja, Rathores, Dakhan, Langah, etc. 
The Sindhi-Sipahi of Rajasthan and the Sandhai Muslims of Gujarat are communities 
of Sindhi Rajputs settled in India. Closely related to the Sindhi Rajputs are the 
Jats of Sindh, who are found mainly in the Indus delta region. However, tribes are 
of little importance in Sindh as compared to in Punjab and Balochistan. Identity 
in Sindh is mostly based on a common ethnicity.</p><br><br>

<h2 span style="color:black">Sindhi Muslims</span></h2>
<p>Abida Parveen is a Pakistani singer of Sindhi descent and one of the foremost 
exponents of Sufi music. With Sindh’s stable prosperity and its strategic 
geographical position, it was subject to successive conquests by foreign empires. 
In 712 A.D., Sindh was incorporated into the Caliphate, the Islamic Empire, and 
became the ‘Arabian gateway’ into India (later to become known as Bab-ul-Islam, 
the gate of Islam).Muslim Sindhis tend to follow the Sunni Hanafi fiqh with a 
substantial minority being Shia Ithna 'ashariyah. Sufism has left a deep impact on 
Sindhi Muslims and this is visible through the numerous Sufi shrines which dot the 
landscape of Sindh.</p>
