   <marquee><h1><b><i><u><dir = up>FOOTBALL</u></i></b></h2></marquee><br>
   <p><b>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees
, kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal. Unqualified, the word 
football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most 
popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly 
called 'football' in certain places include: association football 
(known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football 
(specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules 
football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic 
football.[1][2] These different variations of football are known as 
football codes.</b></p><br>

 <h1><h1><b><i><u>SOURCE & VARIOUS FORM OF FOOTBALL</u></i></b></h2>
  <p>Various forms of football can be identified in history, often as popular peasant 
 games. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these
 games at English public schools during the nineteenth century.The expanse of the
 British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence 
outside the directly controlled Empire.By the end of the nineteenth century,
 distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, 
deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order 
to maintain their heritage.In 1888, The Football League was founded in England,
 becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the twentieth
 century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most 
popular team sports in the world.<br>

<h1><h1><b><i><u>CRAZYNESS OF FOOTBALL</u></i></b></h2>
    <p>The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games,
 some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is 
believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as <q>ἐπίσκυρος</q> 
(Episkyros)or <q>φαινίνδα</q> (phaininda),which is mentioned by a Greek playwright,
 Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian
 Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These games appear to have 
resembled rugby football.The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC)
 describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball
 was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the 
air-filled ball, the follis.Episkyros is recognised as an early 
form of football by <q><b><u>FIFA</b></u></q>.<br>

<h1><b><i><u>FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION</u></i></b></h2>
<p>During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify
 and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring
, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules,
 was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what 
he called "The Simplest Game" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules).
 In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was
 drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow,
 Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.</p><br>
           <p>At the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the 
evening of October 26, 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the
 London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football 
Association (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single 
unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. 
Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the 
association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. 
In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863.
 After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, 
at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently 
published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the 
draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the 
ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious
FA rules were as follows:</p><br>
<ul>
<li> A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries
goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in
case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.</li><br>
<li> If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, 
any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip 
or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and 
hacked at the same time.</li><br>
