<h2 style="text-align:center ;color:#006;  font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; ">The History of Swabia </h2><br>
<br>

<p style="color:#FFF; font-family:'Arial Black', Gadget, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">When you think of Allgäu/Bavarian-Swabia, there is one thing that immediately comes to mind: Neuschwanstein Castle. The royal castle, which was built by Ludwig II, still ranks at the top of the list of the most popular German tourist destinations to this day. Each year, 1.2 million people travel from across the world to Füssen to see the fairytale castle. The towns of Augsburg, Kempten, Memmingen, Wangen and Nördlingen are usually little more than an afterthought. But these towns are all laden with history and are, therefore, also well worth a visit. The best example is Memmingen: It is home to numerous gates, towers and gables, as well as a medieval townscape that is still intact to this day.
Meanwhile, a visit to the Fugger town of Augsburg promises a special insight into Swabian history, as does the Apollo-Grannus Temple, which stands as one of the most important sacred Roman sites north of the Alps. The Austrian Empress Elisabeth also remains part of the history of the region to this day: The former hunting lodge of Duke Max in Bavaria, also known as Sisi Palace, is still a main attraction for fans of the empress.<br>
Allgäu/Bavarian Swabia is also a region that is of special importance where ancient customs are concerned. One example of this is the Viehscheid – the Allgäu variant of Upper Bavarian transhumance: In September, when the mountain summer is coming to an end, the young animals and dairy cows are brought back down into the valley. If the Alpine summer has been a good one and has seen the animals survive without befalling any accidents, the leading animals of the herd are adorned with a festive plaited wreath: the so-called Kranzkühe, which literally translates as "wreath cows" and is one of the most popular tourist photographs taken in the Allgäu. Down in the valley, the animals are ceremoniously returned to their owners during the Viehscheid. The custom dictates that the returning of the animals is accompanied by music and feasts. Lots of other traditional historical festivals can also be experienced live in Allgäu/Bavarian-Swabia.
